ldesc: "jtreg is the test harness used by the OpenJDK test framework. 
This framework is intended primarily for regression tests. It can also 
be used for unit tests, functional tests, and even simple product tests 
-- in other words, just about any type of test except a conformance 
test, which belong in a TCK."
